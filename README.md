# Food Rescue App

This Android application demonstrates the idea of an online marketplace that connects people in an attempt to rescue food from being thrown away.

This application was created with an intention to gain experience in using my previously learnt Android development concepts. This app uses local data storage, therefore it does not have a server-side. 

Packages and APIs used in this app
- SQLite (An abstraction layer was not implemented although it was recommended)
- Google Places API
- Google Maps API
- Google Pay API
